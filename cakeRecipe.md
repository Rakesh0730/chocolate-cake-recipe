this is a recipe of how to make a tasty, simple, chocolate cake.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ingredients:

1. Cooking spray

2. 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch process).

3. 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.

4. 2 cups sugar.

5. 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

6. 1 teaspoon baking soda.

7. 1 teaspoon salt.

8. 3 large eggs, at room temperature.

9. 3/4 cup vegetable oil.

10. 1/2 cup sour cream.

11. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Steps:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farenheit (176.667 degrees Celsius). Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper.

2. Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula. (The batter will be thin.)

3. Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the batter settle. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.
